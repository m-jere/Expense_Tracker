# Expense_Tracker

This is a project I created through CodeAcademy's "Learn Redux Course". I used my skills learned in this course, 
as well as CodeAcademy's "Learn React Course" to build this expense tracker. This project was written and hosted through
the CodeAcademy online IDE using their starter code, then hosted through VS Code to push to Github. 

Through this project, I got introduced to React and Redux, as well as building upon my basic Java skills.
